## Introduction
In the last post, we talked about Spring Web MVC.
This time, we are gonna talk about Spring Security. I'll divide this article into three parts: Generalities, Practical and Architectural. Let's dive in!

## Generalities

### What's Spring Security?

**Spring Security** is a powerful and highly customizable *authentication* and *authorization* framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.[^2]

* **Authentication** is the process of establishing a principal is who they claim to be (a "principal" generally means a user, device or some other system which can perform an action in your application)
* **Authorization** refers to the process of deciding whether a principal is allowed to perform an action within your application

### What's CSRF?
