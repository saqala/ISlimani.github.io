## Introduction
In the last post, we talked about Spring basics including Spring IOC with Spring AOP.
This time, we are gonna speak about what a developer should know in Spring Web MVC, RestFul Web Services, Spring Test and Spring Security.

## Spring Web MVC

### What's Spring Web MVC

> The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications.

### What are the benefits of Spring MVC

Spring Mvc advocates an MVC pattern. MVC provides the following benefits:

* Easiness and fastest development. Since some developers can focus on the view side, others on the models, and so on.

### What's a DispatcherServlet and how does it work?
