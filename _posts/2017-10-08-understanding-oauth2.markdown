## Introduction
If you’re a software developer on the web today, chances are you’ve heard of OAuth.
But what is it, how does it work, and why do we need it?


## What is OAuth 2.0?
*OAuth 2.0 is a delegation protocol, a means of letting someone who controls a resource allow a software application to access that resource on their behalf without impersonating them. It is used to protect a large (and growing) number of web APIs all over the world, from large-scale providers such as Facebook and Google to small startups.*[a link][1]
