## Introduction
So you are about to pass an interview as Full stack spring developer, Backend spring developer and you are wondering what are
the questions that might be asked about spring during the interview. So, you are in the right place.
Interested. Let's dive in!


## The Spring Ecosystem
As a rule of thumb, Spring is too big to cover, that's why, I believe that you didn't include in your resume that you master Spring EcoSystem without specifying what frameworks and modules you mean. If you do so, you are screwed! and don't blame anyone for not picking up you, though that is another topic. That's why we will try to cover the most used frameworks and modules.

Speaking about a modern java-based enterprise application, you will mostly need:

* Spring Core: Ioc (Inversion of Control) container and Spring AOP (Aspect oriented programming)
* Spring WEB: Spring MVC, RestFul Web Services and Spring WebSocket (it depends)
* Spring Test: with JUnit and Mockito
* Spring Boot: less configuration, more focus on business logic
* Spring Security: Who doesn't need that! a Powerful framework to manage authentication and access-control 
* Spring Data JPA: an easy way to implement JPA based repositories
* Spring Social: Connect your application with known social providers, Google, Facebook and Twitter and Others.

## First things first: Basics

### What's JEE:

JEE or Java Enterprise Edition is a **collection of specifications, APIs and technologies** maintained by JCP(Java Community Process) **designed to support Enterprise Applications which usually are large-scale, distributed, difficult to maintain and critical**.

The so-called application servers, like WildFly (formely known as JBoss), GlassFish, etc. are implementations of these specifications.
